Secure Coding Principles Assignment: Regex
Description: To design and implement 12 Regex of different scenarios as described in the assignment and implement 8 "reject" 
	and "allow" cases for unit tests. There should be a total of at least 192 unit tests, 16 for each problem.
Shortcomings: The password Regex fails for minimum password length. Not certain why as I did implement what I intended to be a minimum length.
Extra Credit: I did implement extra credit for ssn as describe at this source: https://www.ssa.gov/kc/SSAFactSheet--IssuingSSNs.pdf
I developed my Regex in Regexr.com and I developed some of my test cases there. Here is my ssn Regex: https://regexr.com/7r6d3
